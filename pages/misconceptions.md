# Misconceptions

Docker is an awesome piece of technology but there are plenty of cases where it is not the right solution or the whole solution. The following module is by no means a comprehensive list of possible misconceptions. But it gives you a sense of what to think about when you evaluate Docker for your specific use and when you start to implement it.
