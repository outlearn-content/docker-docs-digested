# Kitematic and Docker Machine

Kitematic makes it much easier to run Docker containers on Mac or Windows. It gives you a GUI that helps you provision containers. Docker Machine automates creating Docker hosts, whether on your machine or in the cloud. It's good for you to have a basic understanding of how both of these tools work so you are ready to learn more when you need it.

Hope you're having fun!
